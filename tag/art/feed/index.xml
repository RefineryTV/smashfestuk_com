										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The people&#8217;s ark is a participatory public art installation based around the theme of a time capsule. If an asteroid really was going to flatten everything &#8211; what would you want to leave as a memory of yourself, your life, your legacy for a future generation to find?</p>
<p>Our refrigerators often tell a fascinating story. Using magnets we pin to them precious photographs, comforting recipes, poems, inspirational thoughts. We spell out words and phrases with magnetic alphabets and words. If you were to leave on thing pinned to your fridge for the future to know who you were&#8230;what would that thing be?</p>

<p>SMASHfestUK is working in partnership with the British Library who will be making an archive of all of digital images and content which will be collected from this project and this information will be archived on the SMASHfestUK website as part of the British Library Web Archive Special Collections. One of the things they want to include is this is the UK website (not including huge corporations like Facebook, Twitter, Youtube etc) that are important to you right now at this point in your life. To contribute, pop along to see the installation at the Stephen Lawrence Centre, or visit our Pop-Up Arks at the Deptford Lounge or the Albany theatre during SMASHfestUK week.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you can&#8217;t come along but you want to leave a note of your favourite UK website to be archived forever at the British Library, please add in the comments below with your reason for wanting to see this site preserved in its current form as a little piece if history!</p>
