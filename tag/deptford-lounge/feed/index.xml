<h4>TICKETS: <a href="http://www.lyc2015.co.uk/register-your-tickets/" target="_blank">Free but you must register in advance</a></h4>

<p>Its happening! An asteroid is heading for Earth and its getting closer and closer.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The people&#8217;s ark is a participatory public art installation based around the theme of a time capsule. If an asteroid really was going to flatten everything &#8211; what would you want to leave as a memory of yourself, your life, your legacy for a future generation to find?</p>
<p>Our refrigerators often tell a fascinating story. Using magnets we pin to them precious photographs, comforting recipes, poems, inspirational thoughts. We spell out words and phrases with magnetic alphabets and words. If you were to leave on thing pinned to your fridge for the future to know who you were&#8230;what would that thing be?</p>

<p>SMASHfestUK is working in partnership with the British Library who will be making an archive of all of digital images and content which will be collected from this project and this information will be archived on the SMASHfestUK website as part of the British Library Web Archive Special Collections. One of the things they want to include is this is the UK website (not including huge corporations like Facebook, Twitter, Youtube etc) that are important to you right now at this point in your life. To contribute, pop along to see the installation at the Stephen Lawrence Centre, or visit our Pop-Up Arks at the Deptford Lounge or the Albany theatre during SMASHfestUK week.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you can&#8217;t come along but you want to leave a note of your favourite UK website to be archived forever at the British Library, please add in the comments below with your reason for wanting to see this site preserved in its current form as a little piece if history!</p>

In our apocalyptic mini-market, that&#8217;s exactly the situation you&#8217;ll find yourself in. Grab a basket, the countdown clock will begin and you need to make decisions FAST about what your survival strategy will be. Jerk Chicken? Liquorice? Whisky? Whatever you grab from the shelves will be all you have to survive on when the Asteroid hits Deptford. Choose wisely because once you check-out, there&#8217;s no going back!</p>

</a>Patient Zero:</h1>
<h3>Albany Theatre/Deptford Lounge</h3>
<h4>Monday 16th February &#8211; drop-in</h4>
<h4>Wednesday 18th February &#8211; drop-in</h4>
<p>In the aftermath of an asteroid strike in South London, we believe the water supply has become contaminated. Some who have drunk from it are beginning to display worrying symptoms. A shuffling gait, eruptions and oozing skin and a seeming fearlessness. Yes a zombie apocalypse could be about to hit us, but how will we know who is infected? How far might it spread? In this interactive game we will watch as &#8220;infected&#8221; individuals move among us and interact with SMASHfestUK festival goers, silently spreading their deadly menace. Pick up a vial from the Albany Theatre or the Deptford Lounge and take the gamble as we see who are the lucky ones&#8230;..and who becomes <strong><em>contaminated!</em></strong></p>

<p>From meteor showers to giant asteroid impacts, the Earth is constantly bombarded by debris from space.</p>
<p>In IMPACT, we take a look at these fiery visitors and what they mean to us.</p>
<p>Asteroids and comets can cause death and destruction; laying waste to vast areas and are even thought to be responsible for wiping out the dinosaurs!</p>
<p>Could the same really happen to us? According to records only 2 individuals have been known to have been hit by space rocks, but both survived.</p>
<p>Asteroids and meteorites give us vital clues about the violent formation of our Solar System. Plus there’s the chance to see and touch real space rocks!</p>

<p>The exhibition uses spectacular images, film and exhibits to explore how asteroids and comets have shaped our solar system, and what we can learn from them.</p>
<p>IMPACT was originally created by the Royal Observatory Greenwich, who have kindly allowed us to reproduce it for SMASHfestUK.</p>
