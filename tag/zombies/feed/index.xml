										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>albany theatre</h2>
<h4>wednesday 16th february 2015</h4>
<h5>1930 &#8211; 2100</h5>
<p>Tickets: £0/2/4/6/8 (<a title="Moment of Impact Show" href="http://www.thealbany.org.uk/tickets/1470/Family/SmashfestUK---The-Moment-of-Impact-Show-" target="_blank">Free or Pay What You Will</a>)</p>
<p>Its happening! An asteroid is heading for Earth and its getting closer and closer. Over at Mission Control, a crack team have been trying to figure out whether if there&#8217;s a way to avoid Armageddon, but have they managed? You can only find out if you come along and join in the countdown to the Moment of Impact!</p>
<p>This variety extravaganza, will feature an intoxicating mix of performances and events, designed to shock, excite, thrill and make you think about stuff you might not have considered before. Not only will be creating our own comet, live on stage, showing you how you can throw yourself out of a 2 story window without injury, scan your brain for evidence of activity using a set of kitchen scales, and how to protect yourself from a possible invasion of zombies. We will also feature the winner of our open-mic &#8220;SING FOR YOUR LIFE&#8221; competition and be showing the premier of our short drama &#8220;ZOMBIES INVASION: LEWISHAM&#8221; Tickets are free or pay what you can and this is suitable for 12+ to adult. There will be a pay bar.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The quickest, dirtiest blog in the world is to ensue &#8211; quick because the post-it notes stuck all around my Mac screen (my &#8220;to do&#8221; list) have now gone a full circle and are beginning to smother one another, and dirty because I have been so busy that I haven&#8217;t managed to shower yet today (I know, yuck, but its preparing me for the apocalyptic nightmare that is SMASHfestUK which is imminently about to descend on South London)</p>
<p>Questions I have answered in the last hour alone include: &#8220;Can we cope without the star speaker?&#8221; (just), &#8220;can you give us some money by Friday?&#8221; (depends how much), &#8220;how many litres of UV reflective lubricant are we actually going to need?&#8221; (5 gallons, don&#8217;t ask) and &#8220;will the venue mind if I set myself on fire?&#8221; (probably not, but they did object to the preceding question which was &#8220;can I set a member of the audience on fire?&#8221;)</p>
<p>All in all a fairly normal, if hectic, day in the life of a producer. Whilst doing all this and temporarily using my own living room as a production hub with anywhere between 2 and 8 team members here at any one time, the house is like Grand Central Station and oh, did I forget, the builders are in too &#8211; no, that&#8217;s not a euphemism.</p>
<p>If you want to know a bit more about why these questions have arisen &#8211; go have a look on the <a href="./../../../events/index.html">Events</a> page, and some might become clear. If you like what you see, the tickets are beginning to become available on the <a href="http://www.thealbany.org.uk/event_detail/1357/Theatre/SmashfestUK" target="_blank">Albany</a> website&#8230;and come along! &#8211; they&#8217;re free* (or pay what you can) so there&#8217;s nothing to stop you. And we wont set you on fire. Promise. (The insurance won&#8217;t cover it) although we may turn you into a zombie.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>* with the single exception of the <a href="./../../../cabaret/index.html" target="_blank">End of the World Cabaret with Mat Ricardo</a> which is still a TINY SNIP at a fiver or a tenner.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><a href="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/01/BMR7131.jpg"><br />
</a>Patient Zero:</h1>
<h3>Albany Theatre/Deptford Lounge</h3>
<h4>Monday 16th February &#8211; drop-in</h4>
<h4>Wednesday 18th February &#8211; drop-in</h4>
<p>In the aftermath of an asteroid strike in South London, we believe the water supply has become contaminated. Some who have drunk from it are beginning to display worrying symptoms. A shuffling gait, eruptions and oozing skin and a seeming fearlessness. Yes a zombie apocalypse could be about to hit us, but how will we know who is infected? How far might it spread? In this interactive game we will watch as &#8220;infected&#8221; individuals move among us and interact with SMASHfestUK festival goers, silently spreading their deadly menace. Pick up a vial from the Albany Theatre or the Deptford Lounge and take the gamble as we see who are the lucky ones&#8230;..and who becomes <strong><em>contaminated!</em></strong></p>
