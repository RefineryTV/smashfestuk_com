										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>ALBANY THEATRE GARDEN 16TH &#8211; 22ND FEBRUARY</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">SPECIAL BUILD WORKSHOPS FOR 5-16&#8217;S MONDAY 16TH FEBRUARY 2015 1000-1700</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">In the aftermath of a disaster (lets just say for case of argument, a massive asteroid lands on London!) creating shelter from the elements and re-establishing a sense of community is all-important.  Come and join in our survival village at The Albany Theatre Garden. Learn how to make shelters from materials you find lying around that can protect you from the elements. Have a bash at making a geodesic dome out of simple plastic pipes. Come and sit around the campfire and figure out how to make the place feel like home. Whether you&#8217;re a dab hand with a paintbrush and paints or never picked up a power tool in your life, come and build with us!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The quickest, dirtiest blog in the world is to ensue &#8211; quick because the post-it notes stuck all around my Mac screen (my &#8220;to do&#8221; list) have now gone a full circle and are beginning to smother one another, and dirty because I have been so busy that I haven&#8217;t managed to shower yet today (I know, yuck, but its preparing me for the apocalyptic nightmare that is SMASHfestUK which is imminently about to descend on South London)</p>
<p>Questions I have answered in the last hour alone include: &#8220;Can we cope without the star speaker?&#8221; (just), &#8220;can you give us some money by Friday?&#8221; (depends how much), &#8220;how many litres of UV reflective lubricant are we actually going to need?&#8221; (5 gallons, don&#8217;t ask) and &#8220;will the venue mind if I set myself on fire?&#8221; (probably not, but they did object to the preceding question which was &#8220;can I set a member of the audience on fire?&#8221;)</p>
<p>All in all a fairly normal, if hectic, day in the life of a producer. Whilst doing all this and temporarily using my own living room as a production hub with anywhere between 2 and 8 team members here at any one time, the house is like Grand Central Station and oh, did I forget, the builders are in too &#8211; no, that&#8217;s not a euphemism.</p>
<p>If you want to know a bit more about why these questions have arisen &#8211; go have a look on the <a href="./../../../events/index.html">Events</a> page, and some might become clear. If you like what you see, the tickets are beginning to become available on the <a href="http://www.thealbany.org.uk/event_detail/1357/Theatre/SmashfestUK" target="_blank">Albany</a> website&#8230;and come along! &#8211; they&#8217;re free* (or pay what you can) so there&#8217;s nothing to stop you. And we wont set you on fire. Promise. (The insurance won&#8217;t cover it) although we may turn you into a zombie.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>* with the single exception of the <a href="./../../../cabaret/index.html" target="_blank">End of the World Cabaret with Mat Ricardo</a> which is still a TINY SNIP at a fiver or a tenner.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The people&#8217;s ark is a participatory public art installation based around the theme of a time capsule. If an asteroid really was going to flatten everything &#8211; what would you want to leave as a memory of yourself, your life, your legacy for a future generation to find?</p>
<p>Our refrigerators often tell a fascinating story. Using magnets we pin to them precious photographs, comforting recipes, poems, inspirational thoughts. We spell out words and phrases with magnetic alphabets and words. If you were to leave on thing pinned to your fridge for the future to know who you were&#8230;what would that thing be?</p>

<p>SMASHfestUK is working in partnership with the British Library who will be making an archive of all of digital images and content which will be collected from this project and this information will be archived on the SMASHfestUK website as part of the British Library Web Archive Special Collections. One of the things they want to include is this is the UK website (not including huge corporations like Facebook, Twitter, Youtube etc) that are important to you right now at this point in your life. To contribute, pop along to see the installation at the Stephen Lawrence Centre, or visit our Pop-Up Arks at the Deptford Lounge or the Albany theatre during SMASHfestUK week.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you can&#8217;t come along but you want to leave a note of your favourite UK website to be archived forever at the British Library, please add in the comments below with your reason for wanting to see this site preserved in its current form as a little piece if history!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Imagine you have just 30 seconds to gather everything that you need to take into your Survival Shelter to escape the Moment of Impact. In our apocalyptic mini-market, that&#8217;s exactly the situation you&#8217;ll find yourself in. Grab a basket, the countdown clock will begin and you need to make decisions FAST about what your survival strategy will be. Jerk Chicken? Liquorice? Whisky? Whatever you grab from the shelves will be all you have to survive on when the Asteroid hits Deptford. Choose wisely because once you check-out, there&#8217;s no going back!</p>

<p>From meteor showers to giant asteroid impacts, the Earth is constantly bombarded by debris from space.</p>
<p>In IMPACT, we take a look at these fiery visitors and what they mean to us.</p>
<p>Asteroids and comets can cause death and destruction; laying waste to vast areas and are even thought to be responsible for wiping out the dinosaurs!</p>
<p>Could the same really happen to us? According to records only 2 individuals have been known to have been hit by space rocks, but both survived.</p>
<p>Asteroids and meteorites give us vital clues about the violent formation of our Solar System. Plus there’s the chance to see and touch real space rocks!</p>

<p>The exhibition uses spectacular images, film and exhibits to explore how asteroids and comets have shaped our solar system, and what we can learn from them.</p>
<p>IMPACT was originally created by the Royal Observatory Greenwich, who have kindly allowed us to reproduce it for SMASHfestUK.</p>
